# Script to deploy to Amplify via S3
In this simple project, I have written a script to generate another script that uploads to a selective bucket on the basis of user's input.
This is best focused for the developer's usecase where they need not directly edit the script and instead simply pass the parameter, for example; sh or bash s3_upload _bucket_name_.
